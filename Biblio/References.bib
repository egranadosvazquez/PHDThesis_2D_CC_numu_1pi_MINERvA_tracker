The energy range of the incident nucleons was from 500 to 3000 MeV in 500 MeV steps and, similarly, the energy range of the incident pions was from 500 to 2500 MeV. Data from the cascade and evaporation phases are available. A preliminary version of the computer programs used to generate the data is also available. The final version of the programs will be made available in the near future.}

title = {Muon Neutrino Charged Current Single Pion Production on Various Targets in the MINERvA Detector},
author = {Bercellie, Aaron},
abstractNote = {Measurements of neutrino oscillation parameters at accelerator-based experiments require precise knowledge of neutrino interaction cross sections. A significant fraction of neutrino interactions observed in these experiments produce single charged pions. While single charged pion production has been measured on hydrocarbon and water, few precise measurements exist for heavier targets, and there are no high statistics measurements that directly compare pion production on different targets. This thesis measures differential cross sections of muon neutrino charged current single charged pion production with no other mesons in the final state in a neutrino beam with a mean energy of $\approx 6$ GeV. The pion production is studied on targets of scintillator, carbon, water, iron, and lead at MINERvA, a neutrino cross section experiment located in the NuMI beamline at Fermilab. These measured cross sections are differential in $\mu^-$ and $\pi^+$ kinematics. A strong suppression of low $Q^2  $ and an enhancement of low $T_\pi$ are observed relative to commonly used neutrino interaction models in both the light and heavy nuclear targets. Incorporation of these observed effects in future neutrino oscillation experiments will improve their ability to measure energy of neutrino interactions, and therefore measure the parameters governing neutrino oscillations.},

The weak point of the Bayes approach, namely the need of the knowledge of the initial distribution, can be overcome by an iterative procedure. Since the method proposed here does not make use of continuous variables, but simply of cells in the spaces of the true and of the measured quantities, it can be applied in multidimensional problems.}

abstract = {This is an attempt to describe all existing data on neutrino production of single pions in the resonance region up to W = 2 GeV in terms of the relativistic quark model of Feynman, Kislinger and Ravndal (FKR). We considered single pion production to be mediated by all interfering resonances below 2 GeV. A simple noninterfering, nonresonant background of isospin 12 was added. It improved agreement with experiment, particularly in the ratio of isospin amplitudes in charged current reactions, at the expense of one additional constant. All total cross sections, cross section ratios and W-distributions are well reproduced at low and high energies, with charged and neutral currents (supposing the Salam-Weinberg theory with sin2θw ≈ 14 to be correct), and for neutrinos and antineutrinos, giving predictions where data are lacking. New predictions have been made for complex angular distributions in Nπ channels exhibiting strong interference between neighbouring resonances. These are sensitive (for 1.1 GeV ≲ W ≲ 1.5 GeV) to the sign of the Roper resonance P11(1450) which is controversial in photoproduction experiments.}

title = {AFEII Analog Front End Board Design Specifications},
author = {Rubinov, Paul and /Fermilab},
abstractNote = {This document describes the design of the 2nd iteration of the Analog Front End Board (AFEII), which has the function of receiving charge signals from the Central Fiber Tracker (CFT) and providing digital hit pattern and charge amplitude information from those charge signals. This second iteration is intended to address limitations of the current AFE (referred to as AFEI in this document). These limitations become increasingly deleterious to the performance of the Central Fiber Tracker as instantaneous luminosity increases. The limitations are inherent in the design of the key front end chips on the AFEI board (the SVXIIe and the SIFT) and the architecture of the board itself. The key limitations of the AFEI are: (1) SVX saturation; (2) Discriminator to analog readout cross talk; (3) Tick to tick pedestal variation; and (4) Channel to channel pedestal variation. The new version of the AFE board, AFEII, addresses these limitations by use of a new chip, the TriP-t and by architectural changes, while retaining the well understood and desirable features of the AFEI board.},

Based on the neutrino-mixture theory, a possible unified model of elementary particles is constructed by generalizing the Sakata-Nagoya model. Our scheme gives a natural explanation of smallness of leptonic decay rate of hyperons as well as the subtle difference of Gν's between µ-e and β-decay.Starting with this scheme, the possibility of Ke3 mode with ΔS/ΔQ = −1 is also examined, and some bearings on the dynamical role of the B-matter, a fundamental constituent of baryons in the Nagoya model, are clarified.}",
