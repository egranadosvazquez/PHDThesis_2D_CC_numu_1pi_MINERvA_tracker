Reactions were calculated for incident neutrons, protons and charged pions on five elements ranging from oxygen to lead. The energy range of the incident nucleons was from 500 to 3000 MeV in 500 MeV steps and, similarly, the energy range of the incident pions was from 500 to 2500 MeV. Data from the cascade and evaporation phases are available. A preliminary version of the computer programs used to generate the data is also available. The final version of the programs will be made available in the near future.}

title = {Muon Neutrino Charged Current Single Pion Production on Various Targets in the MINERvA Detector},
author = {Bercellie, Aaron},
abstractNote = {Measurements of neutrino oscillation parameters at accelerator-based experiments require precise knowledge of neutrino interaction cross sections. A significant fraction of neutrino interactions observed in these experiments produce single charged pions. While single charged pion production has been measured on hydrocarbon and water, few precise measurements exist for heavier targets, and there are no high statistics measurements that directly compare pion production on different targets. This thesis measures differential cross sections of muon neutrino charged current single charged pion production with no other mesons in the final state in a neutrino beam with a mean energy of $\approx 6$ GeV. The pion production is studied on targets of scintillator, carbon, water, iron, and lead at MINERvA, a neutrino cross section experiment located in the NuMI beamline at Fermilab. These measured cross sections are differential in $\mu^-$ and $\pi^+$ kinematics. A strong suppression of low $Q^2  $ and an enhancement of low $T_\pi$ are observed relative to commonly used neutrino interaction models in both the light and heavy nuclear targets. Incorporation of these observed effects in future neutrino oscillation experiments will improve their ability to measure energy of neutrino interactions, and therefore measure the parameters governing neutrino oscillations.},
